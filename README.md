EMI Calculation Explanation:
EMI stands for Equated Monthly Installment, which is the amount you need to pay every month to repay your loan. The formula to calculate EMI is:

EMI = P * r * (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)

Where:
P is the principal loan amount.
r is the monthly interest rate.
n is the loan tenure in months9 (years * 12).
